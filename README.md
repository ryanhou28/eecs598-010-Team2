# TODO:
- MAC:
  - [ ] Optimize existing designs
  - [ ] 4-bit MAC unit
    - [X] 4-bit Adder
    - [X] 4-bit Multiplier
  - [ ] 8-bit MAC unit
    - [ ] Design 8-bit Adder
    - [ ] Design 8-bit Multiplier
  - [ ] Investigate Dataflow
    - [ ] Weight Stationary Dataflow (seems to be the best choice for FNN)
  - [ ] Investigate Mapping of Weights onto Accelerator
